# Fraud_Prediction_Model
This project is a fraud detection system designed to identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on an analysis of various features in the dataset, such as payment methods, items purchased, and transaction amounts. The system leverages machine learning techniques to train a predictive model that can accurately classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features to ensure consistent input to the model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the dataset to understand key trends and patterns, which helped in feature selection and model building.

Model Training: Employed a Random Forest algorithm for training the model, taking advantage of its robustness and ability to handle imbalanced datasets.

Evaluation: Used a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance, focusing on metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy to assess the detection of fraudulent transactions.

Prediction: The trained model is capable of predicting the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent, allowing for proactive measures to be taken.
# Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:

Payment Method: The method used for the transaction (e.g., credit card, PayPal).

Items Purchased: The specific items bought in the transaction.

Transaction Amount: The monetary value of the transaction.
# Technologies Used

Python: The core programming language used for the entire project.

Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: For model training, scaling, and evaluation.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing the results of the EDA and model evaluation.
